# 👗 Fashion Trend Checker

My first, beginner-friendly Java console application that lets users explore fashion trends across different seasons and years — all from the terminal.

# 🧠 What it does

Fashion Trend Checker is an interactive program where users:

- Select a year (e.g. 2023, 2024, 2025)
- Choose a season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
- Receive a curated list of on trend fashion items for that time period

It's simple, stylish, and a great exercise for anyone learning Java fundamentals.

# 🛠️ Built With

- Java (basic syntax, conditionals, input handling, methods)
- Git & GitHub (project versioning and collaboration)
- 💻 100% developed in-browser using GitHub’s web editor

# 💡 Why this project?

As a fashion enthusiast learning to code, I wanted to blend two passions: style and software.  
This project reflects both — a personal take on how programming can intersect with creativity.

# 📘 What I learned

This project allowed me to:

- Practice Java fundamentals like conditionals, user input, and methods
- Understand how to structure a simple interactive console application
- Use GitHub’s web interface to build and manage a project without local tools
- Write cleaner, more readable code with meaningful structure
